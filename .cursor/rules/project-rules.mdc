JB Networking Systems Website: Project Rules & Standards

This document is the single source of truth for all development. Adhering to these rules is non-negotiable to achieve our goals of a world-class, high-performance, and maintainable website. This project will be built by experts, for experts.

1. Core Philosophy & Stack

Stack Versions:

next: 16.0.0

react: 19.2.0

react-dom: 19.2.0

All other packages (e.g. framer-motion) MUST be the latest available version at the time of installation.

React 19 Compiler: The React Compiler is enabled.



2. Project Structure

App Router: This project MUST use the App Router (src/app). The Pages Router is not permitted.

src/ Directory: All application code MUST reside within the src/ directory.

Atomic Design: All components MUST be structured using Atomic Design principles to ensure modularity and reusability.

src/components/atoms: The smallest building blocks (e.g., Button.tsx, Logo.tsx, Input.tsx, Heading.tsx).

src/components/molecules: Simple groups of atoms (e.g., SearchForm.tsx = Input + Button).

src/components/organisms: Complex component sections (e.g., Header.tsx, HeroSection.tsx, Footer.tsx).

src/components/templates: Page-level layouts (e.g., FullWidthLayout.tsx, SidebarLayout.tsx).

3. Performance (Non-Negotiable)

Server Components First: All components MUST be React Server Components (RSCs) by default.

"use client" is an Exception: A component MUST ONLY be a Client Component ("use client") if it requires interactivity (e.g., onClick, useState, useEffect). Keep Client Components as small as possible (ideally, as "leaf" components) to avoid poisoning the server-side render tree.

next/image: All static image assets (.jpg, .png, .webp) MUST be imported and rendered using the next/image component. The native <img> tag is forbidden.

The priority prop MUST be used on any image that is "Largest Contentful Paint" (LCP), typically the main hero image.

next/font: All fonts MUST be loaded and managed via next/font to eliminate layout shift and optimize font loading. Do not use <link> in the <head> for fonts.

Dynamic Imports: Heavy client-side components (e.g., a complex chart library) MUST be loaded dynamically using next/dynamic with ssr: false.

4. SEO & Metadata

Perfect Score Mandate: The site MUST achieve a 95+ Lighthouse score in SEO.

Semantic HTML: HTML from wireframes MUST be converted using semantically correct tags (<header>, <footer>, <main>, <nav>, <section>, <article>).

Accessibility (A11y): Accessibility is part of SEO. All interactive elements MUST be keyboard-navigable and all images MUST have meaningful alt text (or alt="" for decorative images). We will enforce eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y rules.

Centralized SEO Management: To meet the "single file edit" requirement, all page-level metadata MUST be managed from a central file.

File: src/lib/seo.config.ts

Logic: This file will export a function that generates Metadata objects and JSON-LD scripts for each page.

Example src/lib/seo.config.ts:

import { Metadata } from 'next';

// Define all your SEO templates here
const siteName = "JB Networking Systems";

type PageSEO = {
  metadata: Metadata;
  jsonLd: string; // Or a structured object
};

// Helper to generate JSON-LD script
const generateJsonLd = (data: object): string => {
  return `<script type="application/ld+json">${JSON.stringify(data)}</script>`;
};

export const getPageSEO = (pageKey: 'home' | 'about' | 'services'): PageSEO => {
  switch (pageKey) {
    case 'home':
      const homeJsonLd = generateJsonLd({
        '@context': '[https://schema.org](https://schema.org)',
        '@type': 'FinancialService',
        'name': siteName,
        'url': '[https://jbnetworkingsystems.com](https://jbnetworkingsystems.com)',
        'description': 'Professional Financial & Tax Services, With a Personal Touch!'
      });

      return {
        metadata: {
          title: `Home | ${siteName}`,
          description: 'Professional Financial & Tax Services, With a Personal Touch!',
          // Add openGraph, twitter, etc.
        },
        jsonLd: homeJsonLd
      };

    // ... other cases for 'about', 'services', etc.
  }
};


Example src/app/[lang]/page.tsx (Homepage):

import { getPageSEO } from '@/lib/seo.config';

// 1. Generate Metadata
export async function generateMetadata() {
  const { metadata } = getPageSEO('home');
  return metadata;
}

export default function HomePage() {
  // 2. Get JSON-LD
  const { jsonLd } = getPageSEO('home');

  return (
    <>
      {/* 3. Inject JSON-LD into the head */}
      <head dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: jsonLd }} />

      <main>
        {/* ...Your Page Content... */}
      </main>
    </>
  );
}


5. Internationalization (i18n)

Routing: The site MUST use sub-path routing for languages (e.g., /en/, /es/). This will be handled by a [lang] dynamic segment in src/app/.


No Hardcoded Text: No user-facing text MUST be hardcoded in any component. All strings MUST be pulled from translation JSON files.

we will have 2 languages, English and Spanish.
6. Animation

Provider: We will use framer-motion for all UI animations.

Uniformity: An AnimationProvider.tsx MUST be created in src/providers/ to wrap the application.

Centralized Variants: Common animations (e.g., fadeIn, slideInUp) MUST be defined as variants in a central file (e.g., src/lib/animations.ts) and imported into components. This ensures all animations are uniform and easily editable.

7. Data Fetching & Mutations

Fetching: Data fetching MUST be done in Server Components using await fetch(). This takes advantage of Next.js 16's automatic caching and deduplication.

Mutations: Form submissions and data mutations MUST use Server Actions. Do not create separate API routes for simple form handling. This is the modern, simpler, and more performant standard.

8. Tooling & Quality

Code Style: The project MUST use Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for code linting.

Pre-Commit Hook: A pre-commit hook (using husky) MUST be set up to run eslint --fix and prettier --write before any code is committed. This ensures 100% code consistency.

TypeScript: any is forbidden. All types MUST be explicitly defined. All component props MUST be typed.

Named Exports: All components and functions MUST use named exports. Do not use export default. This improves refactoring and findability in the IDE.

9. UI & Responsiveness

Mobile-First & Fully Responsive: All components and pages MUST be built with a mobile-first approach. The design MUST be fully responsive and pixel-perfect across all common breakpoints, from small mobile devices (320px) up to large desktop screens (1440px+).

Tailwind Breakpoints: Use standard Tailwind CSS breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl) for responsive design. Do not use custom media queries unless absolutely necessary and documented.

No Horizontal Scroll: At no screen width may horizontal scrolling occur.

Fluid Typography & Spacing: Use responsive typography (e.g., text-lg, md:text-xl) and spacing (e.g., p-4, md:p-8) to ensure the UI scales gracefully.
